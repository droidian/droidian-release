# Droidian snapshots don't export i386 packages as they're not needed.
# However, on the buildd side there might be some need to have i386 packages
# around. This support file supplies the i386 repository for the same Debian
# snapshot used as a base.
#
# This is not enabled by default, and you should symlink this in
# /etc/apt/sources.list.d.
#
# This is part of a package (rather than be a buildd-side quirk) so that it
# can be easily updated (especially useful if using the flavour symlink
# rather than the static snapshot version).
